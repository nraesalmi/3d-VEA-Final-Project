An immersive Virtual Reality (VR) horror game developed as the final project for the **3D Virtual Environments and Applications** course.

## Features
- **VR Gameplay**: Experience the spooky environment designed to create an immersive horror experience.
- **Custom 3D Assets**: All assets were modeled in **Blender** and integrated into the game using **Unity**.
- **Interactive Environment**: Interact with objects and navigate the haunted mansion.

## Technologies Used
- **Game Engine**: Unity
- **3D Modeling**: Blender
- **Platform**: VR-compatible hardware

## How to Run
1. Download the project files from the link above.
2. Connect your VR headset and ensure it is set up with Unity.
3. Open the project either in Unity (compatible with Unity version 2022.3.16f1 or higher) or launch the .exe.
4. Start the game and immerse yourself in the experience.

## Assets and Design  
- **Custom Assets**: All 3D assets were created in **Blender**, including environmental props and characters.  
- **AI Pathing**: For enabling chasing mechanics for the ghost, using Unityâ€™s **NavMesh** for pathing.
