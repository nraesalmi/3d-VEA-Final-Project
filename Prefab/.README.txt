steps on how to import prefabs:

1/ windows -> package manager -> install: "XR Plugin Management", "XR Interaction Toolkit" and "Starter asset" in smaples in "XR Interaction Toolkit"

2/ Project Settings -> "XR Plugin Management" -> check "OpenXR" box -> openXR -> Enabled Interaction Profiles, pick "oculus Touch Controller Profile"

3/ import the prefabs

note:
- for VR with animated hands, don't have to import anything else, it's in the package.
- i'm using unity 2022.3.16f1, 3D (URP).
